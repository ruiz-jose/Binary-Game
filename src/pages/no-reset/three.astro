			Here is how that worked: Iframes and elements with animations reset their state as soon as
			they change their position in the DOM. The trick now is to leave them alone. You could do this
			with a version of <code>swap</code> that diffs the elements of old and new DOM and arranges new
			stuff carefully around the raw eggs without touching them.
